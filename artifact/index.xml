      <description>We have a few different types of smoke tests:
 Upload speed smoke test Upload and sync smoke test Sliding window smoke test Feed sync smoke test PSS smoke test (in-progress)  These are all meant to be long-running tests targetted at long-running environments (for example staging-private), so that we know that Swarm process does not have resource leaks, and so that we collect measurements in terms how long it takes to perform these tests on a given Swarm version/commit.</description>
